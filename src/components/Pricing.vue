                <p><b>Who are you and why do you want my trash?</b></p>
                <p>I’m Matthew Allbright, a former software developer who was recently laid off. While searching for my
                    next opportunity, I figured I’d offer my assistance to my neighbors. I don’t <i>want</i> your trash
                    per
                    se — I just want to make your life a little easier. I’ll take your trash to the curb on Sunday
                    evening
                    and bring it back on Monday. No stress, no mess.</p>
                <p><b>So how does this work?</b></p>
                <p>This website acts as a simple booking system where you can seamlessly request my service to put your
                    trash cans out for pickup.</p>
                <p><b>Who is this for?</b></p>
                <p>Anyone in the Warren Park area! Whether you’re going on vacation, assisting an elderly parent, or
                    just don’t have the time, I’m happy to handle it for you.</p>
                <p><b>How much does it cost?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$5 per week – I’ll take your bin to the curb on Sunday and bring it back on Monday.</li>
                    <li>$7.50 per week – I’ll take your trash out on Sunday and bring your recycling to the curb on
                        Monday.</li>
                </ul>
                <P><b>Can I book for multiple weeks?</b></P>
                <p>Certainly, if you'd like to get the month I'd take $17/month.</p>
                <p><b>May I buy on behalf of someone?</b></p>
                <p>That's a great question, as long as they are in Warren Park I'll take out their trash.</p>
