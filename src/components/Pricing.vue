                <p><b>Who are you and why do you want my trash?</b></p>
                <p>I am Matthew Allbright a former Software Developer who was recently laid off. While trying to look
                    for gainful employment I figured I'd offer my assistance to my neighbors. I don't want your trash
                    per
                    say, I want to make your life a bit easier. I'd like to take your trash to the curb on Sunday
                    evening
                    and bring it back on Monday. No fret, no mess.</p>
                <p><b>So how does this work?</b></p>
                <p>I've designed this website to act as a booking site where you can seamlessly request my service of
                    putting your trash cans to the curb.</p>
                <p><b>Who is this for?</b></p>
                <p>Anyone in the Warren Park area. This is for anyone who is looking to take a vacation, assisting an
                    elderly parent, or anyone who doesn't have the time to take the bin to the curb. Well I do and I'd
                    love to curb your bin.</p>
                <p><b>How much does it cost?</b></p>
                <p>For $5, or almost the cost of a latte I'll take your bin to the curb. For $7.50 I'll take your bin on
                    Sunday and your Recycling on Monday. Like you my pickup is Monday for Trash and Tuesday for
                    Recycling.</p>
                <P><b>Can I book for multiple weeks?</b></P>
                <p>Certainly, if you'd like to get the month I'd take $17/month.</p>
                <p><b>May I buy on behalf of someone?</b></p>
                <p>That's a great question, as long as they are in Warren Park I'll take out their trash.</p>
