            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>1. How does the service work?</h3>
                <p>I’ll pick up your trash bins from your driveway or designated spot on Sunday evening, and bring them
                    back on Monday. For trash and recycling, I’ll take both on Sunday and Monday as needed. No need to
                    lift a finger!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>2. Can I pay for multiple weeks at once?</h3>
                <p>Yes! You can prepay for a month and save $1 per week, or pay weekly as needed. Choose whatever works
                    best for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>3. Is this service available outside of Warren Park?</h3>
                <p>Currently, we’re only serving the Warren Park area. But if you’re close by, feel free to reach out,
                    and I’ll see what I can do!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>4. Can I gift this service to someone else?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! If you’d like to gift the service to a friend or family member within the Warren Park
                    area, just let me know, and I’ll take care of the rest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>5. What happens if there is bad weather on pickup day?</h3>
                <p>If the weather is particularly bad on a Sunday or Monday (e.g., heavy rain or snow), I’ll notify you
                    in advance and arrange an alternative plan. Your bins will still get to the curb on time!</p>
